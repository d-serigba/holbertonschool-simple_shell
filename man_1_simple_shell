.SH NAME
hsh \- a simple command line interpreter
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ./hsh
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B hsh
is a command language interpreter that executes commands read from the standard input or from a file. It is designed to mimic the basic functionality of the Sh shell.
.PP
It operates in two modes:
.TP
.B Interactive
When invoked with a terminal attached to standard input, it prints the prompt 
.B ($) 
and waits for user input.
.TP
.B Non-Interactive
When input is piped or redirected to the shell, it executes the commands sequentially and exits.
.SH COMMAND EXECUTION
To execute a command, 
.B hsh
performs the following steps:
.IP 1. 3
Splits the input line into arguments (tokens) using spaces as delimiters.
.IP 2. 3
Checks if the first argument is a built-in command.
.IP 3. 3
If not a built-in, it searches for the command in the directories listed in the 
.B PATH 
environment variable.
.IP 4. 3
If the command is found (or if an absolute path is provided), it creates a child process to execute it.
.SH BUILT-IN COMMANDS
.B hsh
implements the following internal commands:
.TP
.B env
Prints the current environment variables to standard output.
.TP
.B exit
Terminates the shell process. 
.SH EXIT STATUS
Returns
.B 0
upon success.
.br
Returns
.B 127
if a command is not found.
.br
Returns other non-zero values for execution errors.
